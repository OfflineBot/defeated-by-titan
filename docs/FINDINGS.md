# FINDINGS — mistakes I tripped over on the way past

Updated: 2026-08-09

**Whoever trips over something that is not part of their own task: write it down, with the
measurement beside it** — so that somebody else can check whether it really is wrong.

**Do not fix it quietly on the way past.** A foreign mistake fixed in passing is a fix nobody
reviewed, and it hides in the diff of a task where nobody is looking for it
(`prompts/init.md` §9c). Format: `FIND-00n <symptom>` + measurement.

---

## FIND-001 — The anchor density in the backlog is not a number

**Symptom:** `prompts/init.md` §2 calls the anchor density „die wichtigste Zahl" (*the most
important number*) in sheet `08_Maps`. In the table it is qualitative.

**Measurement:** all 12 map rows carry `Sehr hoch` (3×), `Hoch` (4×), `Mittel` (4×) or
`Niedrig` (2×) — `grep -o 'anchor_density: "[^"]*"' docs/backlog/maps.ron`. Not one numeric
value.

**Why it counts:** bible 6.2 makes the anchor density the gate for P3 („Traversal-Zeiten
zeigen messbaren Unterschied zwischen Anfaenger und Experte" — *traversal times show a
measurable difference between beginner and expert*). Four words cannot be tuned and cannot be
checked.

**Whose it is:** level design, not the setup. Recorded as a decision in
[`docs/QUESTIONS.md`](QUESTIONS.md) Q-010.

## FIND-002 — The backlog is written for Roblox in several places

**Symptom:** not only the bible — `01_Spielfunktionen` names Roblox building blocks directly.

**Measurement:** `F-003` demands „Oberflaechen mit CollectionService-Tag `AnchorSurface`",
`F-004` names `RopeConstraint`, sheet `05_VFX` names `ParticleEmitter + Beam`, sheet `08_Maps`
measures in `studs`, `T-001` is called „Rojo- und Git-Aufsetzung".

**Why it counts:** `prompts/init.md` §2 governs the passages in the **bible** and says: what
turns up on top of that while working gets **translated and added to
`docs/architecture.md`** — not followed, not ignored, not asked back. Which is exactly what
happened: the translation table in [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) now has four
rows more.

**Whose it is:** done, nothing open. It stands here so the next person knows that the table
grows instead of being fixed.

## FIND-003 — Sheet 11 of the spreadsheet is an independent cross-check, not a data source

**Symptom:** `prompts/init.md` §2 warns that sheet 11 consists of formulas and, without
`data_only=True`, hands back `=COUNTIF(...)` instead of numbers — possibly without a cached
value at all.

**Measurement:** all 47 formula cells have a cached value (`<v>` next to `<f>`);
`tools/features.py` warns if that ever stops being true. The values agree with our own
extraction **exactly**: 194 / 100 / 100 / 28 / 39 / 118 / 45 / 12 / 51, total **687**, and so
does the priority split of sheet 01 (99 Must / 71 Should / 24 Could).

**Why it counts:** the extraction is thereby **confirmed by the spreadsheet itself**, not
only by our own count. That is worth more than the row-count guard alone — those numbers come
out of a different calculation (`COUNTA` in Excel) than ours.

**Whose it is:** done.

# The counter-check of the vector round (R1-D, 2026-08-09 `[debian]`)

The round was stopped before its counter-check ran. FIND-004 .. FIND-011 are that
counter-check. Every mutation named below was made in the working copy, measured, and taken
back out again; `git status --short` afterwards showed no file of `src/vector/` modified.

**Baseline before anything was touched**, so that every "red" below is a real one:
`cargo test --test vector_hooks --test vector_aiming --test vector_gas --test vector_boost
--test world` → 10 + 8 + 11 + 5 + 7 = **41 passed, 0 failed**.

## FIND-004 — No hook in the real game can anchor: no body in the world carries a `BodyId`

**Symptom:** `F-001` and `F-002` are each green on their own, and together they do nothing.
Every trigger pull in the running game ends as `ReleaseReason::NoAnchor`.

**Measurement:** `cargo run -- --headless --script scripts/f-001-hooks.txt --ticks 800`
(exit 0, "script run finished: 5 asserts held, 536 ticks") logs for two full seconds of
holding, one button each:

```
hook Left  of player 1 found nothing anchorable (t=112)
hook Right of player 1 found nothing anchorable (t=174)
```

Zero `hook … anchored on body …` lines. The cause is static and checkable without a run:
`world::index::maintain_index` (`src/world/index.rs:61-70`) has an **empty body**, and
`grep -rn BodyId src/` finds no other writer of it — so `vector::aim`'s
`Query<(&Body, Option<&BodyId>)>` (`src/vector/aim.rs:65`) always yields `None`, and
`anchor_target` (`src/vector/hook.rs:76-81`) returns `None` on `aim.body?` for **every**
block in the map, tagged or not.

**Why it counts:** no test in the tree can go red on this. `tests/vector_hooks.rs` injects
the carrier by hand into the index (`put_body`, lines 138-147) and forces the `AimPoint`
(`ForcedAim`, lines 52-62); and **no test in `tests/vector_aiming.rs` asserts `AimPoint.body`
at all** — `grep -n '\.body' tests/vector_aiming.rs` returns nothing. The seam between the
two features is the one place neither guard looks. It is honestly written down in both module
headers, which is why this is a finding and not a bug report — but a feature that cannot be
used in the game it is built into does not get past 🟨 on the strength of its unit tests.

**Whose it is:** `T-036a` (`world::index::maintain_index`). Not `vector`.

## FIND-005 — "A shot only leaves from `Idle`" is a decision no test defends

**Symptom:** `src/vector/hook.rs:24-27` spends a paragraph on decision 1 and on its price —
"a lockout after a release: `rope_length / vector.hook_retract_speed_m_s`, so 0.25 s on a
30 m rope". Nothing measures that the lockout exists.

**Measurement:** the most likely broken implementation is an arm that may fire again while
its tip is still coming home. Inserted before the `HookState::Retracting` arm:

```rust
HookState::Retracting if just_pressed && anchor_target(aim).is_some() => {
    let (target_m, body) = anchor_target(aim).expect("checked in the guard");
    next.state = HookState::Flying { target_m, body };
    next.tip_m = hand_m;
}
```

`cargo test --test vector_hooks` → **`test result: ok. 10 passed; 0 failed`**. Reverted with
`git checkout -- src/vector/hook.rs`.

**Why it counts:** `Retracting` is the state that makes the four-state machine a machine
rather than a decoration, and the sentence "that is what makes `Retracting` a state" is
currently 🟨 by the project's own rule. The missing test is one line long: hold, release,
press again inside the retract window, and assert the arm is still `Retracting`.

**Whose it is:** `F-001`, `tests/vector_hooks.rs`.

## FIND-006 — `gas_priority` is an attempt order, not a priority, and the degenerate tank is untested

**Symptom:** `src/vector/gas.rs:12-14` says the priority decides "who pays first" on a tight
tank. What `book()` actually does is *try each consumer in turn*: a consumer that cannot
afford its tick does not stop the ones behind it. At `gas_priority: [Boost, ReelIn]`,
`gas_boost_per_s = 18` and `gas_reel_per_s = 6` (`assets/data/game.ron`, 0.3 and 0.1 per tick
at 60 Hz), a tank holding **0.15** serves `ReelIn` and refuses `Boost` — the lower-priority
consumer wins because the higher one is too expensive.

**Measurement:** turned `book()` into a strict priority — `if !grant.boost { break; }` and
`if !grant.reel_in { break; }` after each `try_spend` — which is the opposite reading of the
same sentence. `cargo test --test vector_gas` → **`test result: ok. 11 passed; 0 failed`**.
Hand-checked against all six unit tests in `src/vector/gas.rs` as well (that binary does not
run them): every one of them uses a tank of 0.35, 0.1 or full, so none puts the tank
**between** the two costs with both consumers wanting. Reverted.

**Why it counts:** which of the two behaviours is wanted is a balancing decision
(`docs/QUESTIONS.md` Q-017) and today it is neither written down nor measured — it is an
accident of a `for` loop. `F-018`'s own words are "at 0 no more flying"; "at 0.15, reel but
no boost" is a rule nobody has agreed to.

**Whose it is:** `F-018` / Q-017.

## FIND-007 — `boost.rs`: `Option<Forces>` and `set_if_neq` are argued for and unguarded

**Symptom:** the doc comment on `gas_boost` (`src/vector/boost.rs:70-74, 88-90`) argues for
both: `Option<Forces>` because "with a plain `Forces` the whole row would drop out of the
query and `BoostAccel` would silently keep the value of the tick before", and `set_if_neq`
because a component reporting itself changed sixty times a second makes every
`Changed<BoostAccel>` filter worthless (§11).

**Measurement:** both undone at once — `Option<Forces>` → `Forces`, `drive.set_if_neq(...)` →
`*drive = BoostAccel(wanted)`. `cargo test --test vector_boost` →
**`test result: ok. 5 passed; 0 failed`**. Reverted.

**Why it counts:** two of the file's five documented decisions are unmeasured. They are not
wrong today; they are simply not *known* to be right, and the next person to touch the query
gets no warning.

**Whose it is:** `F-007`, `tests/vector_boost.rs`.

## FIND-008 — Three of the five acceptance criteria need a HUD, and the HUD is two empty functions

**Symptom:** `docs/features.ron` demands, verbatim: `F-001` "Zustaende sind im HUD sichtbar",
`F-007` "Gasleiste sinkt sichtbar", `F-018` "Gasverbrauch … im HUD ablesbar". None of the
three can be met.

**Measurement:** `src/hud/gas_bar.rs` — `spawn_gas_bar` and `update_gas_bar` both have empty
bodies; there is no hook-state widget anywhere in `src/hud/`; `debug::spawn_overlay` (the F3
overlay that would print the tank) has no caller. Decoded `docs/images/f-018-gas.png` and
`docs/images/f-007-boost.png` pixel by pixel: **0 cyan pixels** in either, of 921 600 — and
cyan is the reserved colour for gas (`docs/conventions.md` §3). There is no bar in either
picture.

**Why it counts:** F-001, F-007 and F-018 are capped at 🟨 by their own acceptance rows, no
matter how green their tests are — exactly as `src/hud/mod.rs` already states for F-018. It
should be stated for the other two as well. On the way past: `src/hud/gas_bar.rs` is still
written in German and links `docs/konventionen.md`, which was renamed to `conventions.md`.

**Whose it is:** `hud` (F-018 image duty), and the stage column of three rows.

## FIND-009 — `HANDOVER.md` §7's test count is wrong by 28

**Symptom:** §1 says "the count before the vector round was **151 green**", §7 says
`origin/session-2026-08-09` is at "**176 tests green**". Both describe this branch.

**Measurement:** counting `#[test]` over `src/**` and `tests/**` per revision:

```
7966f0a (before the vector commit) = 151
1549656 (the vector commit)        = 204
9835b2d (the handover itself)      = 204
c42ff6d (HEAD today)               = 204
```

`grep -rn '#\[ignore' src/ tests/` → 0. So **§1 is right and §7 is wrong**: no revision in
this history has 176, and the handover was itself written on a 204 tree. (`cargo test` also
compiles at most 4 doc-test fences, which can only push the number further above 176.)

**Why it counts:** §7 is the line the next session will quote as "the tree was green at N".
A wrong N turns the first real regression into an argument about arithmetic.

**Whose it is:** `docs/HANDOVER.md`.

## FIND-010 — `STATUS.md` and `features.ron` never learned that the round happened

**Symptom:** the round built four features and 53 tests; the file CLAUDE.md rule 1 calls "the
only truth about the progress" does not know.

**Measurement:** `docs/STATUS.md` — `F-001 ⬜ | —`, `F-002 ⬜ | —`, `F-007 ⬜ | —`,
`F-018 ⬜ | —`, tally "238 ⬜ · 6 🟨 · 1 🟧 · 0 ✅ of 245 rows". `docs/features.ron` — all four
still `stage: Unbuilt` with `evidence: ""`. Meanwhile the four files hold 812 lines
(`wc -l src/vector/{aim,boost,gas,hook}.rs`) and their four test files 1878, 34 of those
tests green (plus 7 in `tests/world.rs`, measured above).

**Why it counts:** this is the *honest* direction of the error — nothing is over-claimed —
but the document of record is 53 tests behind the tree, and `python3 tools/features.py`
regenerates `STATUS.md` from `features.ron`, so the gap does not close by editing STATUS.
`docs/HANDOVER.md` §2 already names it as the last step of the round; it is recorded here so
it is not lost with the handover.

**Whose it is:** the main head (`docs/features.ron` is not a subagent's file).

## FIND-011 — `F-003`'s criterion still cannot be demonstrated, now for a second reason

**Symptom:** `F-003`'s note in `docs/features.ron` says it stays 🟨 because "the acceptance
criterion is 'no hook on untagged parts', and there is no hook yet". There is a hook now, and
the criterion is **still** not demonstrable.

**Measurement:** two things are missing. (1) No test fires a hook at the map's **own**
untagged geometry. The nearest thing, `tests/vector_hooks.rs:602-617`, builds a synthetic
`AimPoint { anchorable: false }` over a hand-inserted index entry — it tests
`anchor_target()`, not the wall at `z = -33.5` from `assets/data/maps.ron`. (2) Because of
FIND-004, **nothing anchors at all**: a run that shows "no hook on the untagged wall" today
shows the same thing on the tagged roof, so it separates nothing. The other two halves of the
same acceptance row — "Tagging-Werkzeug im Studio vorhanden" and "Heatmap zeigt
Flaechenabdeckung" — exist nowhere and have no row in the translation table of
`docs/architecture.md` (only the `CollectionService` tag itself has one).

**Why it counts:** F-003 has been sitting at 🟨 waiting for the hook. The hook arriving did
not move it, and the reason has changed — that should be in the note, or the next session
will re-derive it.

**Whose it is:** `F-003` note in `docs/features.ron`; the missing test belongs to `world`.

## What survived the counter-check — measured, not assumed

Findings that only find fault are worth as little as findings that find none. These claims
were attacked and held:

- **`aim.rs`'s "hit first, then check anchorable" (`F-023`) is real and guarded.** Replaced
  the unfiltered `cast_ray` with a `cast_ray_predicate` that skips non-anchorable bodies —
  the exact "optimisation" the header warns about. **3 of 8 tests went red**, with the reading
  the header predicts: `the ray landed at z = -41 — the untagged wall stands at z = -33.5 …
  Anything past -34 means the ray went THROUGH the wall`, and
  `aim point Vec3(-30.0, 1.5999687, -41.0) instead of Vec3(-30.0, 1.5999687, -33.5)`.
- **`hook.rs`'s "a miss reports `NoAnchor` in the same tick and the arm stays `Idle`" holds in
  the real game**, not only in a test: see the two log lines in FIND-004, and the script's
  `assert speed < 0.5` held both times — a hook that found nothing moved the player by
  nothing.
- **The trigger fires on the edge, not on the hold, in the real game.** Two buttons held for
  60 ticks each produced exactly two log lines, not 120.
- **`boost.rs` does not boost for free.** Changed `if grant.boost` to
  `if grant.boost || intent.pressed(Buttons::BOOST)` — the plausible mistake — and
  `f007_a_held_button_without_a_grant_produces_exactly_zero` went red at
  `left: Vec3(-0.0, 0.0, -34.0), right: Vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. The grant, and only the grant,
  decides.
- **`docs/images/f-007-boost.png` is a measurement and it re-measures.** Decoded and counted
  independently: the brick-red 8 m cube's top face runs x = 404 .. 521, that is **118 px wide,
  centred on 462.5** — the script predicted "(463, 118), 118 px" *before* the run. Ground
  **91.43 %** against the claimed 91.4 %, **0** `ClearColor` pixels, **0** cyan, **0**
  crimson. The sand-brown 4 m block's top face is 54 px against 54 predicted.
- **`docs/images/f-002-aiming.png` shows what its caption claims.** At the image centre
  (640, 360) the pixel lies in the bright top-face band y = 337 .. 381, bounded by cyan
  outline pixels `(0, 237, 255)` at y = 335 and y = 382 — the crosshair is on the **tagged
  roof**. The gray body filling the frame from y = 503 downwards has no cyan boundary — the
  untagged wall, in front of it, not shot through.

*(Append further findings here. A finding without a measurement is an opinion.)*
